      `Cochise fans worldwide are raving about the ease and performance of this 108mm big mountain stomper. 
      Carbon Flipcore combined with camber under foot and a slightly shorter radius sets the standard for 
      precision and stability while 2 sheets of metal, a wood core and vertical sidewalls ramp up the performance 
      in any condition. Add in a higher profile tip with a progressive tip and tail taper, and the soft snow capability 
      can't be beat. Versatile is an understatement - see for yourself!`
